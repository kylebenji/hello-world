Project ideas:
dnd dice rolling game
  -already making a site that will allow you to roll dice, extend this to a game?
    -could have a discrete set of dice that you can roll, take turns rolling, etc.
resume site with my information and a repository for projects that I build
  -link this to linkedin
  -could include my other projects as links within this one
  -would be great if I could get this up as a hosted site accessible from outside a local file
something like pixelstitch?? maybe try to duplicate some functionality, see about image handling
find a couple public projects I'm interested in and see if I can start working with them.
mock up a POS system
clicker game
puzzle box
