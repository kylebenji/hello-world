Project ideas:
dnd dice rolling game
  -already making a site that will allow you to roll dice, extend this to a game?
    -could have a discrete set of dice that you can roll, take turns rolling, etc.
something like pixelstitch?? maybe try to duplicate some functionality, see about image handling
find a couple public projects I'm interested in and see if I can start working with them.
mock up a POS system
puzzle box
get working with APIs
- Spotify
- weather
- etc
Maybe try out some data visualization
