# hello-world

Hi, I'm Kyle! I'm a software developer with experience in healthcare software. I'm currently exploring the world of development and learning a lot. I have experience with C++, Javascript, MUMPS, SQL, Java, and a little bit of python.

I'm interested in full stack or back end development and I believe that I have a lot to offer!
